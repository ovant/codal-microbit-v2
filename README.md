# codal-microbit-v2
CODAL target for the micro:bit v2.x series of devices

# Bluetooth
This repo is a fork of the [original from Lancaster University](https://github.com/lancaster-university/codal-microbit-v2). It is meant to be used with forks of the [samples project](https://github.com/ovant/microbit-v2-samples/) and [nrf sdk](https://github.com/ovant/codal-microbit-nrf5sdk) with the scanning module.

This repo uses the S140 SoftDevice on the Micro:bit v2 to scan for advertising packets from Lightricity beacons.
